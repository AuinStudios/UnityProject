## (29/5/2021)
### (added lighting to the  flamethrower fixed a bug  and i made afterburnt damage but is VERY glitchy right now and clunkly because i dont know how to not instiance more then 1  object)



## (30/5/2021)
### (i couldnt figure out how to not instiance only  1  object at a time so i jut made them to be in the world  but they are disbaled and when the player hits them with a flamethrower they get enabeld and play the effect its not as efficent as instianceing but its abit more effective then just leting them activite all the time and also fixed some bugs and made the player falling physics better bc it was super terrible beforce bc of the drag)


1) (also made it so that the gun doesnt go trhough walls or  the ground anymore but if ur on slopes nad ur looking abit down and goin forward bc of the gun collideing to the slope it will make u not move not a major glithc but it might be annoying)





## (6/06/2021)
### (added better lighting to my game and might add options today as well)


1) (FUCKKING HELL THAT TOOK SO LONG FOR THE FOV SETTINGS OPTIONS but i finally made it so u can change ur fov it saves between scenes but when u leave the scene in the  game the  thing resets back to its default values in the menu ill fix that in future)



## (08/06/2021)
### (theses few days i been working on an options ui thing  it took me 2  days but i finally made it so when u hover over the tab thing it gets abit bigger then becomes abit dark and if u click on it it becomes super dark and  abit bigger but it means u selected it right now  when u hold click on it it  becomes highlighted for some reason and when u click in the air it fixes it self probably is selected not sure but i been working on this for hours so imma stop and torromow im gonna add section changeing to the tabs)




## (09/06/2021)
###  today i made a  score thing when u  scroll the fov and crap but i cant get the tab swtich to work i feel so dumb i want to quit so badly because i have been working on this stupid simple options for almost a  week and im STLL SOMEHOW NOT DONE
